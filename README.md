# Sky Moodslider

## Introduction

A project developed for Sky which suggests films and tv shows to watch, based on the users mood. This project was a success and progressed to the next stage of Sky.

## Scenario 

There is no doubt that content is one of the most important things to Sky. As a result how content is made available and recommended to customers needs careful consideration and Sky is always looking for innovating ways of doing this. 
The Sky Marketing team have asked Software Engineering to create a recommendations application which will enable customers to view content Sky has offer based on their mood. We have called this application ‘Moodslider’ 
Your task is to create a web application that will display content based on what customers tell us they are in the mood for. Once they have made their selections, the application should recommend some content and display it on the page. In addition you will need to provide a feature that will enable content data to be uploaded. Your application should also be Sky branded. 

## Instructions 

Firstly, create a webpage similar to that shown below. The page should display four sliders and a series of emotions. Below the sliders, you should display a series of programme slots that should be made up of an image and title. However at this stage, they should show a ‘No content’ message in the image and title placeholders and the sliders should be set to the centre. You should allow space for 5 programmes. Please also include a navigation bar to make it easier to move around your application. 

Secondly, create a facility where you can upload and process a data file. You can use the data file below as an example but please ensure you add additional data in order to create a more content rich application. You should source your own images and place them in a folder. However the path to the images should be written as part of the data file. The upload facility should be accessed via the ‘upload’ link in the navigation bar and return you to the moodslider page once the upload has taken place. 

Once your content upload is complete, the customer should be able to move the sliders to suit their mood and the application should display a selection of the content you have uploaded which should be based on the preferences they have made. You should focus on moving one of the sliders and retrieving content, however extra credit will be given for retrieving content based on moving multiple sliders and therefore creating a profile based on multiple moods.
